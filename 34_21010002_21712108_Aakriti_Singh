// QUESTION 2
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) describe how documents are presented on screens, in print, or perhaps how they are pronounced.
W3C has actively promoted the use of style sheets on the Web since the consortium was founded in 1994.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) provide easy and effective alternatives to specify various attributes for the HTML tags. 
Using CSS, you can specify a number of style properties for a given HTML element. Each property has a name and a value, separated by a colon (:).
Each property declaration is separated by a semi-colon (;).

EXTERNAL CSSâˆ’ Define style sheet rules in a separate .css file and then include that file in your HTML document using HTML <link> tag.
If you need to use your style sheet to various pages, then its always recommended to define a common style sheet in a separate file.

// THIS IS EXTERNAL FILE
.red {
   color: red;
}
.thick {
   font-size:20px;
}
.green {
   color:green;
}
