External CSS is mostly useful in bigger projects where you can create a sinle CSS file and link it with many html documents.

With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

Syntax:

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="Filename.css">
</head>

EG:

MYSTYLE.CSS

body {
  background-color: blue;
}

h1 {
  color: navy;
  margin-left: 20px;
}
*{ background-color:yellow;
}

Index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a H1</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
