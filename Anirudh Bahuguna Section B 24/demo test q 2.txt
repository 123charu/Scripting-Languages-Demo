External style sheets have the following advantages over internal and inline styles:

one change to the style sheet will change all linked pages
you can create classes of styles that can then be used on many different HTML elements
consistent look and feel across multiple web pages
improved load times because the css file is downloaded once and applied to each relevant page as needed
