To apply a rule to multiple pages, an external style sheet is used. An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet.

The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
</head>
The actual style sheet file will contain CSS rules that are then applied across the entire page. For example:

body {
       background-color: ghostwhite;
}
h1 {
      color: blue; font-size: 20px; font-family: verdana; font-style:italic;
}
In this case, the background color of the webpage will be ghostwhite and any h1 headings will appear in verdana font, as size twenty blue text in italic style.

External style sheets have the following advantages over internal and inline styles:

one change to the style sheet will change all linked pages
you can create classes of styles that can then be used on many different HTML elements
consistent look and feel across multiple web pages
improved load times because the css file is downloaded once and applied to each relevant page as needed
